**Last Updated**: January 14, 2026
**Role**: Front Desk, Medical Assistants (MA)
**Goal**: Zero patients seen without full photo, forms, and history on file.

## 🚨 The "Golden Rule" of Intake
**"If the chart isn't ready, the patient doesn't see the provider."**
Incomplete charts create clinical risks, billing errors, and liability. It is your responsibility to gatekeep this standard.

## ✅ Pre-Visit Checklist (24-48 Hours Prior)

Run this checklist for every patient scheduled for a New Patient Consult or Initial Visit.

### 1. Patient Photo (Mandatory)
*   **Why**: Patient safety (identification), finding them in the waiting room, and personal connection.
*   **Action**:
    *   Check Healthie Profile. Is there a clear face photo?
    *   **IF MISSING**: Send SMS: *"Hi [Name], please upload a profile photo to your portal before your visit tomorrow so we can recognize you! Link: [Healthie Link]"*

### 2. Forms Signed (Mandatory)
*   **Why**: Legal consent to treat and bill.
*   **Action**: Go to Client Profile > Charting > Forms.
*   **Required Forms** (Must be "Completed"):
    *   ✔️ **Men's Health**: *Men's Health Intake*, *Hormone Optimization Consent*, *HIPAA*, *Financial Policy*.
    *   ✔️ **Weight Loss**: *Weight Loss Program Agreement*, *HIPAA*, *Financial Policy*.
    *   ✔️ **Primary Care**: *Membership Agreement*, *Medical History Comprehensive*, *HIPAA*.
    *   **IF MISSING**: Resend form request via Email AND SMS.

### 3. Medical History (Mandatory)
*   **Why**: Providers cannot safely prescribe without knowing allergies and history.
*   **Action**: Check the "Medical History Comprehensive" form or Intake Form.
*   **Verify**:
    *   Are **Allergies** listed? (Or "NKA" checked?)
    *   Are **Current Medications** listed? (Or "None"?)
    *   Is **Past Medical History** filled out?
    *   **IF INCOMPLETE**: Call patient: *"Dr. Whitten needs your full medication list to safely treat you. Can we update that now over the phone?"*

## 🚪 Arrival Protocol (Day of Visit)

### 1. The "Greeting Gate"
When the patient walks in:
1.  **Greet**: "Welcome to Granite Mountain Health!"
2.  **Photo Check**:
    *   *System says no photo?* -> **"Before you sit down, let me snap a quick secure photo for your medical chart."** (Use iPad or Webcam).
3.  **Form Check**:
    *   *System says incomplete?* -> Hand them the iPad **immediately**.
    *   Say: **"We just need to update a few safety forms before the doctor can see you."**

### 2. Rooming the Patient (MA)
Before the provider enters:
1.  **Vitals**: BP, HR, Weight, Temp.
2.  **Confirm History**: "Any changes to your meds since you filled this out?"
3.  **Chief Complaint**: "What is the #1 thing you want to address today?" (Type this in the "Reason for Visit" note).

## ⚠️ Dealing with Pushback

*   **Patient**: "I didn't have time to fill out the forms."
    *   **Staff**: "No problem! We can do it right now. It usually takes about 10 minutes. The doctor will see you as soon as they are done."
    *   *Note*: Do not bring them back until complete.

*   **Patient**: "I don't want my picture taken."
    *   **Staff**: "It's actually a safety requirement for our medical record system so we never mistake you for anyone else. It stays strictly private in your HIPAA-secure chart."

*   **Patient**: "I filled this out last year."
    *   **Staff**: "We update our safety records annually to ensure we have the most current information. Thank you for helping us keep you safe!"
