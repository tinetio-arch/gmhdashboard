        Hi {{contact.first_name}},

        Many men over 35 experience symptoms of low testosterone without realizing it. Here are the top 5 signs:

        **1. Constant Fatigue**
        Feeling tired even after a full night's sleep? Low T affects energy at the cellular level.

        **2. Mood Changes**
        Irritability, depression, or brain fog can all be linked to hormone imbalances.

        **3. Decreased Muscle Mass**
        Losing strength despite working out? Testosterone is essential for muscle maintenance.

        **4. Low Libido**
        A decrease in sex drive is one of the most common symptoms men notice first.

        **5. Weight Gain**
        Especially around the midsection - low T affects metabolism.

        **Sound familiar?**

        The good news: These symptoms are treatable. Testosterone Replacement Therapy has helped millions of men reclaim their energy, focus, and quality of life.

        Hi {{contact.first_name}},

        I wanted to share a quick story with you.

        Mike came to us feeling exhausted, frustrated, and honestly, hopeless. At 47, he thought feeling tired all the time was just "getting older."

        After his initial consultation and labs, we discovered his testosterone was significantly below optimal levels. 

        **Within 4-6 weeks of starting TRT, Mike reported:**
        - Energy levels he hadn't felt in years
        - Better sleep quality
        - Improved mood and mental clarity
        - Lost 12 pounds without changing his diet

        Mike isn't unique. This is what's possible when you optimize your hormones.

        **Your next step:**
        Schedule a FREE consultation. We'll review your symptoms, discuss your goals, and determine if TRT is right for you.

      body: |
        Hi {{contact.first_name}},

        If you've tried dieting and exercise without lasting results, you're not alone. 

        The truth is, for many people, willpower alone isn't enough - and that's not a personal failure. It's biology.

        **Enter GLP-1 Medications (like Semaglutide)**

        These FDA-approved medications work by:
        - Reducing appetite naturally (no more constant hunger)
        - Slowing digestion (you feel full longer)
        - Helping regulate blood sugar
        - Targeting stubborn fat, especially around the midsection

        **What results are possible?**
        Patients typically lose 15-20% of their body weight over 12-16 months when combined with lifestyle changes.

        **Is it right for you?**
        We offer personalized consultations to discuss your goals, health history, and whether GLP-1 therapy could help.
